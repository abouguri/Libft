## üöÄ LIBFT-42: The C Library That's Out of This World!
## ‚òï Artistic View of LIBFT:
#### Welcome aboard the LIBFT spacecraft, where we navigate through the cosmic wonders of C programming. This isn't just a library; it's a constellation of functions shining bright in the programmer's universe!

## üé≠ How Does It Feel?
#### Imagine being a wizard in the world of C, where each function is a spell that brings your code to life. That's LIBFT - a magical toolbox where every function is an adventure!

## üìñ What Exactly is LIBFT?
#### LIBFT is my quest to forge a C library, comprising essential functions I'll be using throughout my coding odyssey at 42 Network. It's like building my own Excalibur for the battles in the realm of programming!

## üîß Mandatory Parts: The Dual Quests
### Part I: The Classics Reimagined
#### Here, I've re-envisioned the standard libc functions, giving them a twist with my prefix "ft_". It's like meeting old friends with new stories.

#### ft_strlen instead of strlen? Absolutely!
#### ft_isalpha, ft_isdigit, ft_isalnum... you name it, I've recreated it!

### Part II: The Innovators
#### The second part is where creativity meets functionality. I've crafted functions that are either missing from libc or exist in an alternate universe.

#### ft_substr: Extracting string essence like a potion master.
#### ft_strjoin: Weaving strings together with the finesse of a wordsmith.
#### ft_split: Splitting strings with the precision of a samurai.
#### ...and many more enchanting functions!

##  üåå The Legend Says: "RTFM!"
#### But here, the manual reads like a storybook of adventures and mysteries unraveling. Dive into each function's tale, from ft_strdup with its magical cloning powers to ft_calloc, the great allocator.

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Use This Cosmic Toolbox
#### 1. Clone this universe: git clone https://github.com/abouguri/Libft 
#### 2. Build your arsenal: Run make and watch the stars align.
#### 3. Include in your epic saga: Use #include "libft.h" and let the magic unfold!

## üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è About the Wizard Behind the Keyboard
#### 23 years old sorcerer of software engineering, delving into the depths of coding, one spell (I mean, function) at a time.
