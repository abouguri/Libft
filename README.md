🚀 LIBFT-42: The C Library That's Out of This World!
☕ Artistic View of LIBFT:
Welcome aboard the LIBFT spacecraft, where we navigate through the cosmic wonders of C programming. This isn't just a library; it's a constellation of functions shining bright in the programmer's universe!

🎭 How Does It Feel?
Imagine being a wizard in the world of C, where each function is a spell that brings your code to life. That's LIBFT - a magical toolbox where every function is an adventure!

📖 What Exactly is LIBFT?
LIBFT is my quest to forge a C library, comprising essential functions I'll be using throughout my coding odyssey at 42 Network. It's like building my own Excalibur for the battles in the realm of programming!

🔧 Mandatory Parts: The Dual Quests
Part I: The Classics Reimagined
Here, I've re-envisioned the standard libc functions, giving them a twist with my prefix "ft_". It's like meeting old friends with new stories.

ft_strlen instead of strlen? Absolutely!
ft_isalpha, ft_isdigit, ft_isalnum... you name it, I've recreated it!
Part II: The Innovators
The second part is where creativity meets functionality. I've crafted functions that are either missing from libc or exist in an alternate universe.

ft_substr: Extracting string essence like a potion master.
ft_strjoin: Weaving strings together with the finesse of a wordsmith.
ft_split: Splitting strings with the precision of a samurai.
...and many more enchanting functions!
🌌 The Legend Says: "Read the Manual!"
But here, the manual reads like a storybook of adventures and mysteries unraveling. Dive into each function's tale, from ft_strdup with its magical cloning powers to ft_calloc, the great allocator.

🛠️ How to Use This Cosmic Toolbox
Clone this universe: git clone git@github.com:abouguri/Libft.git
Build your arsenal: Run make and watch the stars align.
Include in your epic saga: Use #include "libft.h" and let the magic unfold!
